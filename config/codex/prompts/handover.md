Another developer will take over.

Write everything we did so far to progress.md, ensure to note the end goal, the approach we're taking, the steps we've done so far, and the current failure we're working on.

Include a list of relevant files that should be read during takeover (e.g., modified files, configuration files, documentation).

IMPORTANT: When updating progress.md, RESET it completely - do not append to existing content. The file should contain only the current state, not a growing history.
