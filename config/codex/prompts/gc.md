Commit the changes you worked on.

1. Run `git status` to see what's dirty.
2. Only stage files related to your task. Leave unrelated changes uncommitted.
3. Run a single `git add <files> && git commit -m "…"` command.
4. Commit message: concise, imperative, explains the *why*.

No narration before or after. If nothing to commit, say so. If the changeset is unclear, ask.
