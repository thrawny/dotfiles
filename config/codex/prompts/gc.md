## Task

Create one clean commit from the current workspace.

1. Review both staged and unstaged changes so you fully understand what will ship.
2. Confirm which files belong in the commit.
3. Build the **single shell command** immediately (e.g. `git add ... && git commit -m "..."`) and show it.
4. Run that command immediately without asking for approval unless the change set is unclear or mixed.
5. Never include `.envrc`.
6. Keep response tokens minimal; avoid extra narration once the commit command is run.
7. Craft a concise, imperative commit message that follows the existing style and explains the reasoning, not just the edits.

If there is nothing to commit, report that outcome. If the change set feels unclear or incomplete, pause and ask for direction instead of guessing.
