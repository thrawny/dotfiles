description: Pick up work from another developer by reading progress.md and understanding the current state
---

Another developer did some work outside of this conversation, you are picking up from where they left off.

Read @progress.md to get the current state.

Also read any relevant files mentioned in progress.md to understand the context and changes made.

After reading, summarize the current state of the project and what has been done, then wait for further instructions.

CRITICAL: DO NOT modify progress.md at any point during this session. This file is only written at the end of a session during handover. Read it for context but leave it unchanged throughout your work.
